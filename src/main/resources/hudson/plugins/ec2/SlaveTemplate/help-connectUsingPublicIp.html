<div>
	This option controls how the Amazon EC2 plugin connects to the Amazon EC2 instance.
	It is only applicable if the instance belongs to a VPC (and thus it has a Private IP address)
	and it has been configured to have a Public IP address (using the <i>Associate Public IP</i>
	option above). The default plugin behavior in this case is to connect to the instance
	using its Private IP; enabling this option will modify that behavior, and the plugin
	will connect to the instance using its Public IP address.
